To proceed with the original task of training a model and creating a Gradio interface using the uploaded data, I need to identify suitable features and a target variable from this new dataset. Given the available columns, 'HMP Isolation Body Site' appears to be the most plausible categorical variable that could potentially serve as a target for classification. The other columns are primarily identifiers or descriptive text. Therefore, I will attempt to use 'HMP Isolation Body Site' as the target variable and engineer features from other relevant columns, or if that is not feasible with the current data, I will have to finish with failure. For now, I will select 'HMP Isolation Body Site' as the target and drop columns that are clearly identifiers or not useful for prediction. I will then handle missing values and encode the target variable.\n",
